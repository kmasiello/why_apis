# **APIs**: you're probably not using them and why you probably should
### Presented by: **Katie Masiello** | Adapted from: **Josiah Parry**
### **RStudio Customer Success**

???
I've been working around APIs for over a year and gleaning pieces from talks here and there, 
but it wasn't until recently when my colleague Josiah and I were talking through this material today that I felt like I'd internalized it and it all really clicked.  
I hope the discussion today is transformative for you as well.

#Where are you in your data science journey? 
#Where is your organization?

???
I want to start by framing things a bit asking you to think about where you are in your data science journey? 
Are you brand new to this and the tools, are you in a place where you and/or the organization needs to mature and adopt new tools and workflows?   
I get to talk to a lot of teams in this role and what is neat is getting a pulse on where teams are on the continuum of maturity. 
---
# Common Pain Points
* "I've created a Shiny beast!"

* "How do we share this code with another system / group?"

* "We are replicating work in every project"

???
Often when teams are going through some maturation pains, we hear things like this.  
Sometimes you build out a solution but the solution itself becomes the problem in that it's either difficult to maintain or update, or supporting it in production is unwieldy.  
These are some of the ways individuals and teams take steps in maturity.

# Changing Data Science Landscape

???
organizations and the overall landscape for data science is maturing as well.
---
# Data Science in 2021  

* Part of production applications  

* Beyond ad hoc reports, visualizations, and dashboards  

* Need to equip data scientists with production tools  

* Dependence on IT   

* To succeed, we need to embrace DevOps  

* How? Microservices    

???
we see modern data science teams doing these things.
---
# Monolithic Mindset
```{r  out.width = "60%", echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("slides_files/monolith.png")
```

???
a solution may start out as what we think of as a monolith.  
A singular beast.  but I'd like to encourage you to think of a more efficient way to build, productionize, and sustain assets.
---
# Lean it out with Microservices
```{r  out.width = "90%", echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("slides_files/microservices.png")
```

???
we want to lean things out with what we call microservices.  
smaller assets that do singular work

If you follow best practices with version control / github, you'll undoubtedly be diligent about committing changes in small bundles all aligned with one particular piece of work.

# TL;DR - APIs

* Application Programming Interfaces  

* Machines talking to machines

* RESTful APIs use HTTP

* Think of HTTP as a universal language

???
these are the basics of APIs.  
What you may have heard before, right? It's how machines talk to one another.  You're using an API just to call up a website like cnn.  
But lets get into it a bit more to help internalize this a bit more. 
---
# Think of APIs as a way to access functions
General form of an API: 
```
http://hostname/api_endpoint/?parameter=value
```

Example function:
```{r}
my_function <- function(argument) {
  some_kind_of_operation(argument)
}
```

As an API: 
```
http://hostname/my_function/?argument=value

```
???
you write a function in R to do something.  
an API becomes a way to access that.  the general form is:
and it maps out like this:

# Think of APIs as a universal adapter

.center[<img src="slides_files/dockingstation.png" height = 325>] 
  
.center[<img src="slides_files/dockingstationDescription.png" width = 1000> ]
???
I'm a mechanical engineer by training. 
I think in terms of physical things. tools.  nuts and bolts and fasteners. fluid flowing in pipes.  
so another way to think of APIs is like an adapter. 
you've got this black box thing.  it doesnt really matter what's inside, how it got there, what language it was written in, or anything else.  
As long as you've got something that fits into the USB-shaped hole that's in it, you can plug something in, like a keyboard or thumb drive into that hole.  
the input signal that you send to the black box adapter interfaces with the computer and you get some kind of output in response.
this is equivalent to plugging your R or Python based code into the API's endpoint with specific input parameters and the API returns an output.

# The Case for APIs

Traditional Data Science Tool Box

* Reports

* Presentations

* Spreadsheets

* Interactive Dashboards

* *all limited to end user consumption*
  
Extend your reach with APIs!
???
So now we know more about what an api is.  
What's so great about them?  For one, if we look at the traditional data science toolbox it may include any number of these traditional things.
but they're all limited to end user consumption.  
they require some kind of user interaction.  
an API permits you to eliminate the human interaction.

# The Case for APIs
.pull-left[<h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #447099;">
Organizational </h3>

* Smaller pieces are easier to manage

* Component monitoring 

* Infrastructure for recycled code `r emo::ji("recycling_symbol")`

* Less technical debt! 

* Better change management

* Upgrade one service at a time without bringing down whole application

]

.pull-right[<h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #447099;">
Collaborative </h3>

* Less friction and effort in tool handoff 

* Empower teams to use preferred tool chain `r emo::ji("fire")`

* Concerned about API requests not software language

* No need to translate work

* Programmatic use of services

* *Glue together API requests! Pipelines, baby!* <img src="slides_files/pipe.png" height="20" style="vertical-align:middle">
]

???
this is a lot but a few things i want to point out - APIs let you lean things out like we talked about.  
breaking things into smaller, reusable chunks.  you can spend less time troubleshooting and focus on the smaller pieces of the puzzle for change management and upgrading.  
Even more compelling I Think is you can eliminate friction between groups. teams can use whatever language is preferred and there's no recoding required.  
this enables automation and programmatic use of services, and you really feel like a superstar when you start gluing together pipelines of API requests.

we've used these words already but lets reiterate some vocabulary and concepts.

# API Requests
* Each API endpoint has a different **method**  

* GET
  * Used to <span style="background-color:#fff2cc">*retrieve*</span> data. Parameters only. No body.
  * Everything is in the URL.
  * Don’t send sensitive data! 
  
* POST
  * Used for sending data (files or text). More secure.
  * Creating or modifying something.
  
* Other methods:
  * PUT
  * DELETE (yikes!) `r emo::ji("skull_and_crossbones")`
  * HEAD
  * …
