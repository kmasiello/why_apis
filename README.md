At our annual conference rstudio::conf 2020, Alex Gold (Solutions Engineer at RStudio) presented some additional ways to bring your R work into production using Plumber: https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2020/deploying-end-to-end-data-science-with-shiny-plumber-and-pins/

Another excellent conference talk is James Blair’s rstudio::conf 2019 talk “Democratizing R with Plumber APIs” where he takes an existing Shiny application that uses an R model and turns the model into an API so it can be used by other applications: https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2019/democratizing-r-with-plumber-apis/

See Barrett Schloerke’s talk “plumber + future: Async Web APIs” from rstudio::global 2021 for asynchronous calls to APIs: https://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/plumber-and-future-async-web-apis/
